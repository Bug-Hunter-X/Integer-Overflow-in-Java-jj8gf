This repository demonstrates a common yet often overlooked error in Java programming: integer overflow. The `UncommonBug.java` file contains a simple program that adds 1 to the maximum possible integer value.  This results in an integer overflow, causing the result to wrap around to a negative value. The `UncommonBugSolution.java` offers a solution using `long` which avoids the overflow problem. This example highlights the importance of careful data type selection to prevent unexpected behavior and data corruption.
